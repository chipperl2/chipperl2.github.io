                     <p>
                          People with special dietary restrictions may become frustrated or confused by the lack of visibility for food items that comply with these restrictions. Not being able to easily know if a restaurant accommodates their needs can make picking a place to eat a difficult task. Our solution would provide users with a resource to more easily find restaurants and food items that fit their dietary needs.
